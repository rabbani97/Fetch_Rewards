# ****# First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model****
## Review the 3 sample data files provided below. Develop a simplified, structured, relational diagram to represent how you would model the data in a data warehouse.
 ### The diagram should show each tableâ€™s fields and the joinable keys. You can use pencil and paper, readme, or any digital drawing or diagramming tool with which you are familiar. If you can upload the text, image, or diagram into a git repository and we can read it, we will review it!
